## Project Overview

The **BMI Calculator NZ** is a web-based tool designed to help individuals calculate their BMI easily and quickly. The tool takes input for age, gender, height, and weight, then computes and displays the BMI along with a category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese). For children, BMI is calculated based on age and gender-specific percentiles.

## Features

- **Input options** for height and weight in both metric (cm, kg) and imperial (inches, lbs) units.
- **Interactive chart** to visualize the user's BMI in relation to standard BMI categories.
- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **Age-based calculation**: The tool calculates BMI differently for adults and children, adjusting for specific growth patterns.
- **Form validation**: Prevents invalid input with a visual shake effect for incorrect fields.
